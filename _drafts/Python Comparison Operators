Python Comparison Operators

== | Equal to
!= | Not equal to
<  | Less than
>  | Greater than
<= | Less than or equal to
>= | Greater than or equal to

Don't get confused with = and == operators. The = operator assigns a value to the variable. The == operator compares whether or not the value on teh left of the sign is the same as teh value on the right of the sign.

Assignment:
>>> number = 1
>>> number
1

Comparison:
>>> 'number_1' == 'number_1'
True

These operators evaluate to True or False.
For example:

>>> 89 > 43
True

>>> 100 >= 120
False

>>> 50 == 60
False

>>> 123 != 321
True

>>> 'Bonjour' == 'Bonjour'
True

Yes, it case sensitive.

>>> 'Mighty Mouse' == 'mighty mouse'
False

Integers do NOT equal Strings

>>> '100' == 100
False
