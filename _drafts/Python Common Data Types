Python Common Data Types

# Define DATA-TYPES in plain english

Integers | -5, -3, -1, 0, 1, 3 , 5
Well, they are integers.

Floating-point numbers | -2.25, -1.3, -0.6, 0.7, 1.8, 15.9
You guessed it Floating-point numbers have decimals.

Strings | 'q', 'we', 'rty', 'Bonjour', 'What is your name?', '12 regenerations'
Always wrap your strings in single quotes('Like this'). This way Python can read where your string begins and where your string ends.

Booleans | True or False
There are only two values to a boolean data type. It is either True or False. In Python they always start with a capital T or F with the rest of the word in lowercase. They are not surrounded by quotes. Quotes will turn it into a string.
