Yes, you can *wink* a picture with Google Glass. When I first heard this, I thought it was a bogus report from someone who had heard something from someone who didn't really know. You know, the game of telephone. I mean, I have Google Glass and I didn't think the report was real. First, I checked the apps available and the closest thing I found was Winkfeed (see below). I figured that someone saw that app and got confused.

As it turns out, the ability to wink a picture is native to the device and came with one of the latest updates. I am slow to writing about this (because I have been distant from my blog for a while -- so here's to sharing old news), but I have been using the wink feature for a few weeks. I have found that I am quicker on the draw at taking photos now. I always have my camera ready at my eye.Â  This is a pro. And here is a con, I have been taking more random photos of nothingness. I have been restraining myself from posting them. Which I imagine, once Google Glass goes mainstream, you can expect Facebooks feeds, Google + feeds, and Twitter feeds will be filled with pictures of nonsense. Much like the food pics people show in their feeds now. :)

Taking a photo and sharing it is as easy as -- *Wink* -&gt; "Ok Glass, share photo" with 'name social media site here' -&gt; DONE -or- "Add a Caption" -&gt; Say what you want -&gt; DONE, photo and comment are shared.
