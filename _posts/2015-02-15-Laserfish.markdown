Navigate the sea as the minnows' protector, LaserFish. Grow and protect your school of minnows from the deadly piranha and sharks. Save minnows and collect gems to upgrade your laser. Are you just another minnow or are you LaserFish? 

Tilt your mobile device left, right, forward, and backward to control LaserFish's swimming. 

Collect gems and protect minnows to upgrade your laser gun.

Don't get bit by the piranha or sharks, bites take away health, and some steal gems.
Don't let them get past you either or they will snack on your fellow minnows and steal your gems. 

Do you have what it takes to be a SUPERFISH? Find out what you can do, just don't get bit. Beware of the piranha, leopard sharks, gray sharks, and the deadly Great White!
