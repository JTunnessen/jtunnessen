It is time to move on from those static picture displays that show you how to operate a fitness machine. You know, the line drawn pictures of the man or woman in three different poses operating the fitness machine that you are about to get on. The ones that are generally on some random uncovered piece of the machine. It is 2012, surely we can do better than that. What about offering the correct way to operate the machine by video?

The landscape of the fitness industry has changed. Gone are the days of not allowing cell phones on the work out floor. Your members are on the work-out floor listening to their music on their smartphone, texting people, checking Facebook, reading emails, and logging their workout in one of the numerous fitness apps (such as Gym Buddy) they just downloaded. Some of them are even getting their training advice from these apps like  P90X, All-in Yoga, or Fitness Buddy. Doesn’t it make sense to harness this ability to connect with your members? What if they were getting their training advice from you?

It is time to make every one's life a little easier and put QR codes on the workout machines. On every smartphone there is a camera and the owner of that phone probably has a QR code reader app on that phone. And if they don’t? Don’t worry, they can download one for free at the iTunes App Store. You could also post signs in the club as to where they could download a free QR code reader. Maybe even at the bottom of the QR code sticker on the machine.

How it will work...

The member will walk up to the machine, scan the QR code, and instantly be directed to your website showing a video of how to use the machine. If this technology isn’t offered by the manufacturer you could easily record one of your personal trainers giving a period of instruction on how to use the machine. At the completion of the video the trainer could let the learner know that if he has any questions about anything in the facility please don’t hesitate to ask.

This simple adjustment in your club can provide greater exposure for your personal trainers, word-of-mouth advertising from your members talking about it, and give your sales associates something new to talk to potential members about. By analyzing the available technology and adhering it to club constants you have the ability to revolutionize your club and provide it with a competitive edge.

####Benefits:
Membership: Members that are too shy to ask questions now have the ability to see how to use the equipment without asking for help. This also puts a face with a name of a personal trainer inside your club in which the member will be more likely to reach out to.

Personal Training: At the end of the video you could offer the opportunity for a fitness assessment or personal training session with the swipe of a finger. You could place a link at the end of the video that allows for personal training or nutritionist appointment scheduling.
