Business collaboration tools, such as Chatter, are taking companies by storm. It makes sense, these tools provide the most efficient way to increase productivity, boost morale, and create a sense of community within your organization. But how should you “act,” post, respond, and question on these platforms? If you are already engulfed in the social media phenomenon in Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn, then you probably already know or have a good idea as to how you should contribute to these collaboration tools. To address this, I have created an aptly titled list provided below. The list is called Business Social Network Etiquette. I know, fancy names, right?

## BUSINESS SOCIAL NETWORK ETIQUETTE ##

1) **DO NOT TYPE IN ALL CAPS!** Typing in ALL CAPS online represents shouting. Unless you are shouting and you want everyone online to know it and know it forever (because it does not go away), refrain from typing in all caps.

2) **Do not post inflammatory comments.** Trying to get a rise out of someone online is not the best way to show your professionalism.

3) **Point out misguided behavior.** If you notice someone is doing something they probably should not be doing eg. TYPING IN ALL CAPS. Help them out. Respond to their post or send them a direct message letting them know the error of their ways.
 
4) **Ignore people who just don’t take the hint.** The hint being they are not appropriately participating on the business collaboration tool. An example would be someone that has been corrected numerous times by their colleagues and yet continues to post inappropriately. Do not get sucked in by their antics. Simply ignore them and report them to the administrator.
 
5) **Accept guidance from your community leaders.** These community leaders are group leaders/creators, network influencers, and (for you Tipping Point groupies) connectors.
 
6) **Keep your posts business oriented.** This is a business site, so we should be talking about business.
 
7) **Think before you post.** A good way to look at it -- DO NOT POST anything that you do not want your boss’s boss’s boss’s boss’s boss’s boss to see.
