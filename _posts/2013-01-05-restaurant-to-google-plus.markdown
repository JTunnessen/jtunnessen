It's the little things that get you... I usually use my Open Table app to book restaurant reservations, but I heard there was a Zagat app so I went looking for it.

It turns out that the Zagat app is only available for Android OS devices and of course it is synced with Google+. I use "iDevices" so the app is unavailable for me and I have not used Google+ since I set it up about a year ago when I was just experimenting with Facebook's new competition. Out of curiosity, I downloaded the Google+ app to my iPad and gave it a once over. I must say Google+ looks great. It is a welcome change from Facebook. The UI is easy to use and if I wasn't already in Facebook I would certainly move over to using that as my primary FRMS (Friend Relationship Management System).

This is specifically where I think Google is having trouble with increasing user adoption. Facebook has become so ingrained in every detail of online activity and mobile life that it has become natural for people to post, like, or poke automatically and without effort. I noticed an article the other day that Google has been building and developing people's Google+ pages without them really knowing (If you have a Gmail account, or a YouTube account...then you have a Google+ page.). This is their method of competing with the already socially ingrained Facebook and, despite the possible ethical quandary, it may work. If you and your friends will not take the time to build your Google+ pages and transfer your online life reporting, then Google, the company that knows everything you search for on the Internet, will. Eventually moving from Facebook to Google+ will not be so laborious.

Anyway, to solve the Zagat app issue I simply created an app bookmark on the home screen of my iPad which is synced with my iPhone, so I am good to go on that front. Now after writing this on my iPad, while I watch TV, I am going to post it ... which, of course, it will go out to Facebook, Twitter, WordPress, and Google+.
