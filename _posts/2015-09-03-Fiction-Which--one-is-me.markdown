I’m a writer and an entrepreneur, I love the cloud. And that is one of the reasons I do love the cloud. Any device I have on me, I can start writing my notes on that device and they are all housed in the same spot. I don’t have to search around for that great idea I had the other day. I know where it is. It is right here. It is in my little section of the cloud.  

At least, that is how I used to feel. Until my life was invaded and turned upside down. They were in the cloud. Nobody said they were there. They had access to all my stuff. Everything I had put there. Everything the cloud was collecting. They could construct a whole other me. I think they did.They absorbed my information, my knowledge, everything that I had shared in my little section of the cloud. But they got more as well. They had my search history. They had my bank accounts. They had my bills. They had my music preferences. They had my family life, it was all posted on Facebook. They had my (I thought funny) anecdotes that I posted on Twitter. They had my cell number, my email, my home number, and my address. They had my purchase history from all the online mega-shops, small online stores, and physical stores. How did they get the physical stores? It wasn’t that hard, they just looked at the credit card statements. 

They knew my travel. I had really enjoyed the digital assistant features of my smart devices. So I had left the GPS on even though it was a bit of a drain on my phone. I checked in on Foursquare and sometimes on Facebook and Twitter. They knew my routes, my common stops, how long it took me to get from where to where and through predictive analytics they knew where I was going before I went there.It was all there, in the cloud. They accessed it and that was it. I was no longer me. Well, I was me, but so were others.
